To assist our farmers make informed decisions we provide a mobile app (aedenthorn's mod required) to help you track these shifts. Alternatively, local shops can give you a basic overview of supply but won't be able to help with exact prices.^^The best way to get a feel for things is by doing, but there are two important points we'd like to make sure you are aware of: ^^1. Prices are locked in on a day by day basis^2. Supply levels will be updated every season.^^Best of luck farmer  -- Ferngill Economic Board",
